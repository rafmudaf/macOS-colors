# Useful color palettes for macOS

I have an affinity to the default color palette in [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org),
and so when I use Excel or any other software for plotting I
spend a lot of time changing each series color to match the
base matplotlib colors. There's a better way! Define a color
palette in macOS system colors and select it in the software
you're using.

Included color palettes:
- [matplotlib base](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html)
- [matplotlib tableau](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html)
